# Assignment 1

All source code for this assignment is in the `src` folder. All declaration and description of functions are in the header files in that folder.

To compile this project, you can run the `./compile` shell script included in the base of this repo.
The Makefile is included in the `build` folder. In the same folder, you will also find the compiled C code for this assignment.
Alternatively, just run the play button in an IDE 😉️.

Note: Compiling this project was intended with version 3.16, but you can always re-generate the Makefile with the `CmakeLists.txt` file included in the base of this repo.
